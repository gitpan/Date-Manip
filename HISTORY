   *** Switched to a package (patch supplied by Peter Bray
      o  renamed to Date::Manip
      o  changed version number to 2 decimal places

      o  "Tue Jun 25 1996" wasn't parsed correctly (regexp was case
         sensitive)
      o  full day names not parsed correctly
      o  the default day in ErrorCheck should be 1, NOT currd since when
         currd>28, it may not be a valid date for the month

Version 5.05  1996-10-11
   Added Swedish translation (thanks to Andreas Johansson
   Fixed bad mistake in documentation (use Date::Manip instead of
      use DateManip) pointed out by tuc@valhalla.stormking.com
   Fixed bug introduced in 5.04 when default day set to 1.  When no
      date given, have day default to today rather than 1.  It only
      defaults to one if a partial date is given.
   Changed deltas to be all positive or all negative when produced by
      DateCalc.  Suggested by Steve Braun
   Fixed bug where Date_DaysSince999 returned the wrong value (the
      error did not affect any other functions in Date::Manip due to
      the way it was called and the nature of the error).  Pointed out
      by Jason Baker
   Minor improvements to documentation.
   Documented the 'sort within a sort' bug.
   Added DateManipVersion routine.
   Dates with commas in them are now read properly.
   *** Now supports timezones.
   *** Parses RFC 822 dates (thanks to J.B. Nicholson-Owens for suggestion).
   Parses ctime() date formats (suggested by Matthew R. Sheahan).
   *** Added Date_ConvTZ routine for timezone support.
   Fixed two places where a variable was declared twice using my (thanks
      to Ric Steinberger).
   Hopefully fixed installation problems.
   Now supports times like "noon" and "midnight".
   Got rid of the last (I think) couple of US specific strings.
   The time separators are now language specific so the French can
      write "10h30" and the Swedes can write "10.30".  Suggested by
      Andreas Johansson.
   Fixed type in documentation/README pointed out by James K. Bence.
   Fixed bug in Date_SetTime (didn't work with $hr,$min,$sec < 10).
   Added ModuloAddition routine and simplified DateCalc.
   Date_TimeZone will now also check `date '+%Z'` suggested by
      Aharon Schkolnik.

Version 5.06  1996-10-25
   Fixed another two places where a variable was declared twice using my
      (thanks to Ric Steinberger).
   Fixed a bug where fractional seconds weren't parsed correctly.
   Fixed a bug where "noon" and other special times were not parsed
      in the "which day of month" formats.
   Added "today at time" formats.
   Fixed a minor bug where a few matches were case sensitive.
   ParseDateDelta now normalizes the delta as well as DateCalc.
   Added %Q format "YYYYMMDD" to UnixDate.  Requested by Rob Perelman.
   The command "date +%Z" doesn't work on SunOS machines (and perhaps
       others) so 5.05 is effectively broken.  5.06 released to fix this.
       Reported by Rob Perelman.

Version 5.07  1996-12-10
   Huge number of code changes to clean things up.
   Added %q format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" to UnixDate.  Requested by Rob Perelman.
      Also added %P format "YYYYMMDDHH:MM:SS".
   Added a new config variable to allow you to work with multiple internal
      formats (with and without colons).  Requested by Rob Perelman.
      See Date_Init documentation.
   Added the following formats suggested by Andreas Johansson:
         sunday week 22 [in 1996] [at 12:00]
         22nd sunday [in 1996] [at 12:00]
         sunday 22nd week [in 1996] [at 12:00]
   *** Added weeks to ParseDateDelta.  Suggested by Mike Bassman.
      Note that since this is a late addition, I did not change the
      internal format of a delta.  Instead, it is added to the days
      field.
   Added a new config variable to allow you to define the first day of
      the week.  See Date_Init documentation.
   Added the following formats to ParseDate for conveniance (some were
      suggested by Mike Bassman):
         next/last friday [at time]
         next/last week [at time]
         in 2 weeks [at time]
         2 weeks ago [at time]
         Friday in 2 weeks
         in 2 weeks on friday
         Friday 2 weeks ago
         2 weeks ago friday
   Added Date_SecsSince1970GMT, moved the %s format to %o (secs since 1/1/70)
      and added %s format (secs since 1/1/70 GMT).  Based on suggestions by
      Mark Osbourne.  Note this introduces a minor backward incompatibility!
   Date_SetTime now works with international time separators.
   *** Changed how Date_Init arguments work.
   Fixed bug in Date_TimeZone where it didn't recognize +HHMN type time
      zones.  Thanks to Are Bryne.
   Added the %g format (%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z) for an RFC 1123 date.
      Suggested by Are Bryne.
   Added WindowsNT check to Date_TimeZone to get around NT's weird date
      command.  Thanks to Are Bryne.
   Subroutines now check to see if 4 digit years are entered.  Suggested
      by Are Bryne.
   Fixed typo (CSD instead of CST).
   *** Now reads a config file.
   Added options to delete existing holidays and ignore global config file.
   *** The d:h:mn:s of ALL deltas are normalized.
   Added local($_) to all routines which use $_.  Suggested by Rob
      Perelman.
   Date_GetNext and Date_GetPrev now return the next/prev occurence of a
      time as well as a day.  Suggested by Are Bryne.
   *** Complete rewrite of DateCalc.
   In approximate mode, deltas now come out completely normalized (only 1
      sign).  Suggested by Rob Perelman.
   *** Added business mode.  See documentation.  Suggested by Mike Bassman.
   *** Modified how deltas are normalized and added the DeltaSigns config
      variable.
   *** Added test suite!
   Fixed sign in military timezones making Date::Manip RFC 1123 compliant
      (except that timezone information is not stored in any format)
   Added Date::Manip::InitDone so initialization isn't duplicated.
   Added a 3rd internal format to store YYYY-MM-DD HH:MN:SS (iso 8601).
   Fixed a bug where UnixDate %E format didn't work with single digit
      dates.  Patch supplied by J\yrgen N\yrgaard.
   Added a config variable to allow you to work with 24 hour business
      days.  Suggested by Mike Bassman.
   ParseDateDelta now returns "" rather than "+0:0:0:0:0:0" when there is
      an error.
   Fixed a bug where "today" was not converted to the correct timezone.

Version 5.07p2  1997-01-03
   *** Added lots of timezone abbreviations.
   *** Can now understand PST8PDT type zones (but only in Date_TimeZone).
   Fixed some tests (good for another year).
   Fixed a bug where a delta component of "-0" would mess things up.
      Reported by Nigel Chapman.
   Released two patches for 5.07.

Version 5.08  1997-01-24
   *** Fixed serious bug in ConvTZ pointed out by David Hall.
   *** Modified Date_ConvTZ (and documented it).
   Released 5.08 to get this and the other two patches into circulation.

   Upgraded to 5.003_23 and fixed one problem associated with it.
   Used carp and changed all die's to confess.
   Replaced some UNIX commands with perl equivalents (date with localtime
      in the tests, pwd with cwd in the path routines).
   Cleaned up all routines working with the path.
   Tests work again (broke in 5.08).  Thanks to Alex Lewin and Michael Fuhr
      for running debugging tests.

Version 5.10  1997-03-19
   Tests will now run regardless of the timezone you are in.
   Test will always read the DateManip.cnf file in t/ now.
   A failed test will now give slightly more information.
   Cleaned up In, At, and On regexps.
   DateManip.cnf file in t/ now sets ALL options to override any changes
      made in the Manip.pm file.
   Added documentation for backwards incompatibilities to POD.
   Added 2 checks for MSWin32 (date command and getpw* didn't work).  Thanks
      to Alan Humphrey.
   Fixed two bugs in the DateCalc routines.  Pointed out by Kevin Baker.
   Fixed some problems in POD documentation.  Thanks to Marvin Solomon.
   Fixed some problems with how "US/Eastern" type timezones were used.
      Thanks to Marvin Solomon.
   Fixed minor POD error pointed out by John Perkins.
   Added a check for Windows_95.  Thanks to Charlie W.
   Changed documentation for Date_IsWorkDay (it was quite confusing using
      a variable named $time).  Thanks to Erik M. Schwartz.
   Cleaned up checks for MacOS and Microsoft OS's.  Hopefully I'm catching
      everything.  Thanks to Charlie Wu for one more check.
   Fixed typo in docs (midnight mispelled).  Thanks to Timothy Kimball.

      other languages as well).  Thanks to Georges Martin.
   Added ROK timezone.  Thanks to Kang Taewook.
   Fixed a bug in DateCalc.  Thanks to Thomas Winzig.
   Removed the "eval" statement from CheckFilePath which causes a suid
      c wrapper program to die when it calls a Date::Manip script.
      Thanks to Hank Hughes.
   Fixed a bug in business mode calculations.  Thanks to Sterling Swartwout.
   Fixed a bug in which "1997023100:00:00" was accepted as valid.  Thanks
      to Doug Emerald.

Version 5.21  1998-01-15
   Documented how to get around Micro$oft problem.  Based on a mail by
      Patrick Stepp.
   Now passes Taint checks.  Thanks to Mike Fuhr, Ron E. Nelson, and
      Jason L Tibbitts III.
   Put everything in a "use integer" pragma.

   Added a missing space in the %g UnixDate format.  Thanks to Mike Booth.
   Fixed some Australian time zones.  Kim Davies.

   *** Changed DateManip.cnf to Manip.cnf (to get rid of problems with
      certain OS's that can't handle filenames that aren't 8.3 characters)
      for ALL non-Unix platforms (Wintel, VMS, Mac).  For all Unix platforms,
      it's still .DateManip.cnf .  Also, it will only look in a users home
      directory on VMS and Unix.
   Added info about the RCS problem.  Supplied by Kipp E. Howard.
   Added "Y:M:0*-DOM:0:0:0" to ParseRecur.  Jeff Yoak.
   Added A.M. and P.M. parsing (not just AM and PM).  William W. Arnold.

   Fixed a bug where "-1second" was treated as a date rather than a delta
      in DateCalc.  Kenneth Ingham
   Restricted timzeones parsing to 0000-2359 instead of 0000-9999.
      Frank Cusack
   Added a bit to the Makefile.PL (as it was distributed in the Win32
      Perl Resource Kit).  Murray Nesbitt
   Fixed a German initialization problem.  Thomas Horster-Moller
      and Christian Reithmaier

Version 5.33  1998-08-20
   Added Spanish support.  Bautista Jasso Javier
   Fixed a bug where "1 month ago" was no longer working (and added it
      to the test cases).  This broke when I fixed the "-1second" bug
      above.  A result of this is that a number of "deltas" can be parsed
      as dates (i.e. &ParseDate("1 hour 20 minutes ago") is equivalent to
      &DateCalc("now","1 hour 20 minutes ago")).  Only text deltas can
      be used in this way (i.e. &ParseDate("-0:0:0:0:1:20:0") will not
      work).

Version 5.34  1999-04-13
   Fixed a bug where a date passed in as an array wasn't getting the
      date removed from the array.  Rick Wise
   Added tests for MPE/iX OS.  John Testa
   Fixed a bug where WorkDayBeg=8:00 went into an infinite loop.
      Mark Martinec
   A number of typos fixed.  Ron Pero
   Added exact business mode.  Ian Duplisse
   Changed a business week to be the same as an exact week.  Abigal
   Added Portuguese.  Rui Pedro da Silva Leite Pereira
   *** Switched all variables from Date::Manip::VAR to my(VAR).  This means
      no more access to Date::Manip internals.  Based on suggestion by
      Tom Christiansen
   Changed %z UnixDate format to return the GMT offset.  Tuc
   The format "22nd sunday" now returns the real 22nd sunday, NOT the sunday
      of week 22 (based on whatever definition of week 1 is active).
   Fixed a bug where "sunday week 0" didn't work (only affected week 0)
      Gerald Rinske
   Minor bug (my variable declared twice).  Paul J. Schinder
   Added "mmmYYYY" and "YYYYmmm" formats.  As a result, "DDYYmmm" and
      "mmmDDYY" formats changed to "DD/YYmmm" and "mmmDD/YY".  David Twomey
   *** Added Date_Cmp routine.  This will work even after the new internal
      format goes into affect.  Added now in response to a question by
      Al Sorrell (I should have added it earlier).
   At the request of the UN, I added the SAT timezone.  :-)  Howard Hendler
   Fixed a bug where "epoch SECONDS" was getting parsed wrong (for SECONDS
      which could be interpreted as an ISO-8601 date).  N. Thomas
   Fixed a problem where init files were not being read.  Mike Reetz
   Fixed a bug where timezones were converted multiple times if ConvTZ was
      set and DateCalc called.  Steven Hartland

Version 5.35  1999-07-06
   Added Romanian support (including 2 test files).  Iosif Fettich
   Made "epoch" not case sensitive and fixed a bug where it would fail in
      some languages.  Caught because of Iosif's thorough Romanian test file.
   Fixed a problem where "in 5 days/weeks/months" sometimes wouldn't get
      correctly parsed in other languages.  Caught because of Iosif's
      thorough Romanian test file.
   Fixed a weakness in ParseDateDelta brought out by the Romanian delta test
      file.
   Corrected Swedish translations.  Danne Solli
   Documentation updates.
   Modified Date_GetPrev/Date_GetNext to take $curr=2.
   Now parses the Apache log file format "dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss (time zone)".
      Mark Ferguson
   Added OS/2 support.  Michael B. Babakov
   Fixed a bug causing warnings in the beta version of perl.  Patch by
      Paul Johnson.
   Some fixes to German translations.  Peter Ehrenberg
   Deprecated the function Date_DaysSince999.  It's been replaced by
      Date_DaysSince1BC.  It will disappear in the next version.
   Fixed support for years 0000-0999.  Requested by Chris Vaughan
   Many changes to recurrences including:
      *** Flags are now supported
      Some bug fixes and documentation changes
      Added test suite
      Added support for Easter (first suggested by Abigal).

      namespace and to make a few future enhancements easier to do.
   Added Italian.  Nicola Pedrozzi
   Added Israel timezones.  Oded Cohen
   Fixed a bug where business weeks weren't being used correctly.  Qian Miao
   Improved holiday support considerably:
      *** Added support for recurrences and one-year-only holidays (the latter
         requested first by Vishal Bhatia.
