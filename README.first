Date::Manip 6.00 represents a complete reorganization (and almost complete
rewrite) of the module. It includes the original functional Date::Manip
module, and a number of OO modules which now do the real work. The OO
modules may also be used directly, bypassing the functional interface.

As of 6.00, Date::Manip has full support for all timezones in the standard
Olsen database (and also supports all Windows timezone names, and timezones
suggested by several other standards). Full support for daylight saving
time is included.

Please refer to the Date::Manip::Changes5to6 and Date::Manip::Migration5to6
man pages for a more detailed breakdown of changes made in 6.00, and
suggestions for a few changes which may be required to get existing code
to run using the new modules.

It should be noted that version 6.00 required perl 5.10 or higher.
